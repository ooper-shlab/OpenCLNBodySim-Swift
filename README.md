# OpenCL_NBody_Simulation

Translated by OOPer in cooperation with shlab.jp, on 2015/2/21.

Adapted to Swift 1.2 beta3 on 2015/3/14.

The translated code does not utilize simd functionalities, which may affect the performance.
(Sorry for who that has reached here searching simd usage example in Swift...)
