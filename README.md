# OpenCL N-Body Simulation

Performs an N-Body simulation which calculates a gravity field and corresponding velocity and acceleration contributions accumulated by each body in the system from every other body.  Shows how to mitigate computation between all available devices including CPU and GPU devices, as well as a hybrid combination of both, using separate threads for each simulator.
